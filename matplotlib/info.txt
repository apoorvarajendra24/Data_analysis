# Line plot 
When to Use a Line Plot?
Use Case	                    Why Use a Line Plot?
Time-series data	            Shows trends over time.
Comparing multiple trends	    Shows how two or more datasets change together.
Identifying seasonality	        Highlights repeating patterns.
Detecting anomalies	            Shows sudden spikes or drops.

Key Points:
âœ… Use list comprehension ([val**2 for val in y]) for lists.
âœ… Use NumPy (y**2) for easy mathematical operations.
âœ… Operations can be performed inside plt.plot() directly.

# Bar plot
When to Use a Bar Plot?
âœ… Comparing categorical data
âœ… Showing trends over time (e.g., sales per year)
âœ… Visualizing distributions in groups

Key Takeaways for grouped bar chart
âœ… Use np.arange(len(categories)) to generate x positions.
âœ… Shift bars left and right using x - offset and x + offset.
âœ… Adjust width to prevent bars from overlapping.

# Historam
When to Use a Histogram?
âœ… To analyze distributions of numerical data
âœ… To visualize patterns (e.g., normal vs. skewed distributions)
âœ… To compare multiple datasets

# Scatter plot
When to Use a Scatter Plot?
âœ… To analyze relationships between two variables
âœ… To detect patterns, correlations, or clusters
âœ… To visualize noisy data distributions

ðŸŽ¯ Key Takeaways
âœ” Bigger scaling factor â†’ Larger spread
âœ” Smaller scaling factor â†’ Tighter spread
âœ” Multiplication controls how wide the values can be

# Pie chart
When to Use a Pie Chart?
âœ” To show proportions of categories
âœ” When categories sum up to a whole (100%)
âœ” When there are few categories (3-6) for clarity
